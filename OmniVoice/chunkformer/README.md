## Introduction
ChunkFormer is an ASR model designed for processing long audio inputs effectively on low-memory GPUs. It uses a **chunk-wise processing mechanism** with **relative right context** and employs the **Masked Batch technique** to minimize memory waste due to padding. The model is scalable, robust, and optimized for both streaming and non-streaming ASR scenarios.

## Key Features
- **Transcribing Extremely Long Audio**: ChunkFormer can **transcribe audio recordings up to 16 hours** in length with results comparable to existing models. It is currently the first model capable of handling this duration.
- **Efficient Decoding on Low-Memory GPUs**: Chunkformer can **handle long-form transcription on GPUs with limited memory** without losing context or mismatching the training phase.
- **Masked Batching Technique**: ChunkFormer efficiently **removes the need for padding in batches with highly variable lengths**.  For instance, **decoding a batch containing audio clips of 1 hour and 1 second costs only 1 hour + 1 second of computational and memory usage, instead of 2 hours due to padding.**

| GPU Memory | Total Batch Duration (minutes) |
|---|---|
| 80GB | 980 |
| 24GB | 240 |

## Usage

### Feature Extraction
```python
from chunkformer import ChunkFormerModel
import torch

device = "cuda:0"

# Load a pre-trained model from Hugging Face or local directory
model = ChunkFormerModel.from_pretrained("khanhld/chunkformer-ctc-large-vie").to(device)
x, x_len = model._load_audio_and_extract_features("path/to/audio")  # x: (T, F), x_len: int
x = x.unsqueeze(0).to(device)
x_len = torch.tensor([x_len], device=device)

# Extract feature
feature, feature_len = model.encode(
    xs=x,
    xs_lens=x_len,
    chunk_size=64,
    left_context_size=128,
    right_context_size=128,
)

print("feature: ", feature.shape)
print("feature_len: ", feature_len)
```
### Python API
#### Classification

ChunkFormer also supports speech classification tasks (e.g., gender, dialect, emotion, age recognition).

```python
from chunkformer import ChunkFormerModel

# Load a pre-trained classification model from Hugging Face or local directory
model = ChunkFormerModel.from_pretrained("path/to/classification/model")

# Single audio classification
result = model.classify_audio(
    audio_path="path/to/audio.wav",
    chunk_size=-1,  # -1 for full attention
    left_context_size=-1,
    right_context_size=-1,
)

print(result)
```

#### Transcription
```python
from chunkformer import ChunkFormerModel

# Load a pre-trained encoder from Hugging Face or local directory
model = ChunkFormerModel.from_pretrained("khanhld/chunkformer-ctc-large-vie")

# For single long-form audio transcription
transcription = model.endless_decode(
    audio_path="path/to/long_audio.wav",
    chunk_size=64,
    left_context_size=128,
    right_context_size=128,
    total_batch_duration=14400,  # in seconds
    return_timestamps=True
)
print(transcription)

# For batch processing of multiple audio files
audio_files = ["audio1.wav", "audio2.wav", "audio3.wav"]
transcriptions = model.batch_decode(
    audio_paths=audio_files,
    chunk_size=64,
    left_context_size=128,
    right_context_size=128,
    total_batch_duration=1800  # Total batch duration in seconds
)

for i, transcription in enumerate(transcriptions):
    print(f"Audio {i+1}: {transcription}")

```

### Command Line
#### Long-Form Audio Transcription
To test the model with a single [long-form audio file](samples/audios/audio_1.wav). Audio file extensions ".mp3", ".wav", ".flac", ".m4a", ".aac" are accepted:
```bash
chunkformer-decode \
    --model_checkpoint path/to/hf/checkpoint/repo \
    --audio_file path/to/audio.wav \
    --total_batch_duration 14400 \
    --chunk_size 64 \
    --left_context_size 128 \
    --right_context_size 128
```
Example Output:
```
[00:00:01.200] - [00:00:02.400]: this is a transcription example
[00:00:02.500] - [00:00:03.700]: testing the long-form audio
```

#### Batch Audio Transcription
The [data.tsv](samples/data.tsv) file must have at least one column named **wav**. Optionally, a column named **txt** can be included to compute the **Word Error Rate (WER)**. Output will be saved to the same file.

```bash
chunkformer-decode \
    --model_checkpoint path/to/hf/checkpoint/repo \
    --audio_list path/to/data.tsv \
    --total_batch_duration 14400 \
    --chunk_size 64 \
    --left_context_size 128 \
    --right_context_size 128
```
Example Output:
```
WER: 0.1234
```

#### Classification
To classify a single audio file:
```bash
chunkformer-decode \
    --model_checkpoint path/to/classification/model \
    --audio_file path/to/audio.wav
```
